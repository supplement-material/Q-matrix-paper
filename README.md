The first excel file ("coef_chiu_countries") was to show the estimated results of five countries in the GDINA model based on the Q-matrix refined by Chiu's method. The row refers to the items and the column refers to estimated coeffcients for parameters.
The second excel file ("model comparison results between DINA and GDINA") was to show the model comparison results between DINA and GDINA based on the original expert-designed Q-matrix.
